    <h3>What is Angular</h3>
    <p>
        This topic can help you understand Angular: what Angular is, what advantages it provides, and what you might expect as you start to build your applications.
    </p>
    <div>
       <p> 
           Angular is a development platform, built on <a href="#">TypeScript</a>. As a platform, Angular includes:
         </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
            <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more</li>
            <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.

    <h3>Angular applications: The essentials</h3>
    <p>
        This section explains the core ideas behind Angular. Understanding these ideas can help you design and build your applications more effectively

    <h5>
        Components
    </h5>
    <p>
        Components are the building blocks that compose an application. A component includes a TypeScript class with a @Component() decorator, an HTML template, and styles. The @Component() decorator specifies the following Angular-specific information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template. HTML elements in your template that match this selector become instances of the component.</li>
        <li>An HTML template that instructs Angular how to render the component</li>
        <li>An optional set of CSS styles that define the appearance of the template's HTML elements</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <p>The following is a minimal Angular component.</p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular1.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>To use this component, you write the following in a template:</p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular2.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            When Angular renders this component, the resulting DOM looks like this: 
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular3.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
<p>
    Angular's component model offers strong encapsulation and an intuitive application structure. Components also make your application painless to unit test and can improve the overall readability of your code.

    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <p>
        Every component has an HTML template that declares how that component renders. You define this template either inline or by file path.
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            Angular extends HTML with additional syntax that lets you insert dynamic values from your component. Angular automatically updates the rendered DOM when your component's state changes. One application of this feature is inserting dynamic text, as shown in the following example.
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular4.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The value for message comes from the component class:
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular5.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            When the application loads the component and its template, the user sees the following:
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular6.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Notice the use of double curly braces--they instruct Angular to interpolate the contents within them.

            Angular also supports property bindings, to help you set values for properties and attributes of HTML elements and pass values to your application's presentation logic.
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular7.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Notice the use of the square brackets--that syntax indicates that you're binding the property or attribute to a value in the component class.

            Declare event listeners to listen for and respond to user actions such as keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and touches. You declare an event listener by specifying the event name in parentheses:
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/img/whatangular8.PNG" alt="image">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The preceding example calls a method, which is defined in the component class:
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The following is a combined example of Interpolation, Property Binding and Event Binding within an Angular template:
